# Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Pricing

## Project Overview
This project explores how Reinforcement Learning (RL) can support **pricing decisions in a competitive retail environment**.  
Instead of relying on fixed rules or static models, the RL agent learns to adjust prices dynamically in response to:

- Changing customer demand  
- Competitor pricing strategies  
- Seasonal fluctuations (weekends, holidays)  
- Limited inventory availability  

The objective is to maximize long-term revenue and profit while protecting market share.

## Why This Matters
Dynamic pricing is one of the most powerful terms for improving financial performance.  
Traditional approaches often fail to adapt quickly enough to external changes.  

This project shows how an RL-based approach can:  
- Detect when demand is weakening and lower prices to maintain sales  
- Identify strong demand periods and increase prices to maximize margin  
- Balance revenue growth with inventory management  
- Provide actionable recommendations to decision-makers

## Methodology
- **Custom RL Environment**: `DynamicPricingEnv` simulates demand, competition, seasonality, and inventory.  
- **Replay Buffer**: Implemented to stabilize agent learning.  
- **DQN and Double DQN**: Trained with TensorFlow/Keras to explore price actions and maximize long-term rewards.  
- **Evaluation**: RL strategies compared against static baselines (low, medium, high price).

### Technical Details
- A custom simulator, `DynamicPricingEnv`, was implemented to replicate realistic pricing conditions such as demand shifts, competitor actions, seasonality, and inventory constraints.  
- Two RL methods were applied:  
  - **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)** to estimate action values and choose optimal prices.  
  - **Double DQN** to address overestimation bias and improve stability.  
- The environment and agents were built in Python using TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, and supporting libraries.

## Key Insights
- **Static low-price strategy** drives sales but reduces overall profitability.  
- **Static high-price strategy** increases margins per unit but limits volume and market share.  
- **Reinforcement Learning strategy** achieves the best trade-off:  
  - Prices are adjusted based on market conditions  
  - Profits are higher compared to static approaches  
  - Inventory is utilized more efficiently

## Business Value
This project illustrates how AI can be integrated into pricing strategy to:  
- Improve profit margins without sacrificing competitiveness  
- Provide transparency in decision-making through data-driven insights  
- Reduce reliance on manual rule-setting and guesswork  
- Adapt continuously as customer behavior and market dynamics change  

Industries that can benefit include:  
- Online retail and e-commerce  
- Travel and hospitality  
- Subscription-based businesses

## Next Steps
- Incorporate more complex customer behavior (e.g., loyalty, churn risk)  
- Test reinforcement learning strategies against real transactional datasets  
- Deploy as a prototype tool for pricing managers to simulate different scenarios
