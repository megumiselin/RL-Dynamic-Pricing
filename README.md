# RL-Dynamic-Pricing
This project applies Reinforcement Learning to dynamic pricing, using a custom environment that simulates demand, competition, seasonality, and inventory limits. The RL agent learns adaptive pricing strategies that balance sales and profit, outperforming static approaches and supporting business decision-making.
